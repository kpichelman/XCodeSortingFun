# XCodeSortingFun

# Jan 1, 2025 - Initial Code Complete
I finished the first pass as the code.  Running the sorts I started to see the mergesort winning but more updates are needed to track multiple runs and gather best and worst case along with average times.  Running the sorts several times and "picking" a time that seemed average to me, here are the results.

4 Word Sort
Bubble = .00003696
Insert = .00004291
Merge  = .00002599

104 Word Sort
Bubble = .0009390
Insert = .0007539
Merge  = .0005590

1004 Word Sort
Bubble = .2141770
Insert = .0796950
Merge  = .0131849
